# minutemesh

This project must be flashed to development board compatible with MeshCore. You need at least one other node to receive packets constructed by the firmware.

In August 2025, an exploit named [meshmarauder](https://meshmarauder.net/tutorial-01%20Background%20and%20Recommendations.html) was used to 'poison' the contact lists of users by capturing and rebroadcasting another node's NodeInfo packet after modifying the field containing their public key. Because NodeInfo packets are Trust-on-First-Use, they noted that nodes receiving a forged packet would associate the sender's MAC address with the illegitimate public key. In addition, this included user "name" information, which was modified to be "[WARNING] Meshtastic is insecure".

Mesh networks are particularly useful in emergency communications, especially when existing infrastructures are unavailable. This technology currently being pitched as military or first-responder technology, keeping them secure is of massive importance.

This project highlights numerous issues with Meshtastic's form of authentication in public and private channels, by allowing users to send a fake packet at the push of a button. By connecting to the serial port, users may send a packet with an arbitrary user ID and message.

Currently, there is no counter-measure to this implemented in the Meshtastic protocol. Users may ignore other users, but doing so ignores the impersonated user, not the attacker.

## Usage

Run the `./build.sh` script with the arguments `build-firmware` and whatever device you have. 

After flashing the firmware to the device, run the command `craft_packet` with your message to send the message to the minutemesh channel from the default radio, VimCard. To specify a different "sending" radio, add the MAC address of the radio as an argument before the message.

To specify a different channel, modify `MINUTEMESH_KEY` located in [CraftPacket.h](./src/CraftPacket.h) with the channel key and modify the channel hash in [CommonCli.cpp](./src/helpers/CommonCli.cpp:437).

## Flashing

Download precompiled firmware releases - [github.com/datapartyjs/MeshTNC/releases](https://github.com/datapartyjs/MeshTNC/releases)

We haven't built a flashing tool yet. You can flash builds using the meshcore flasher, the OEM provided flashing tools or using the developer instructions to flash using VS Code.

- Flash using your platform's OEM flashing tool
- Use the meshcore flasher - http://flasher.meshcore.co.uk/


## Hardware Compatibility

MeshTNC is designed for devices supported by MeshCore so check their support list in the [MeshCore Flasher](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk). We support most of the same hardware see [variants](https://github.com/datapartyjs/MeshTNC/tree/main/variants).

## Serial CLI

The MeshTNC firmware initially starts up in a serial mode which is human readable. You can connect to the serial console using a serial terminal application. You may have to configure the baud rate, which defaults to `115200`. The following command uses `minicom` to connect to the serial port, please replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with the proper device node for your serial port:

`minicom -b 115200 -D /dev/ttyACM0`

It may be helpful on Linux systems to run the following command to set the default baud when interacting with the serial port:

`stty -F /dev/ttyACM0 115200`

Once connected, the MeshTNC device has a simple CLI. The CLI is largely similar to MeshCore with a few notable additions.

### CLI additions

 * `txraw <hex...>` - Transmist a packet
 * `get syncword <word>` - Read the syncword setting
 * `set kiss port <port>` - Set the KISS device port
 * `set radio <freq>,<bw>,<sf>,<coding-rate>,<syncword>` - Configure the radio
 * `serial mode kiss` - Switch to KISS mode
 * `rxlog on`
   * Output format: ` [timestamp],[type=RXLOG],[rssi],[snr],[hex...]\n`
 * `set`/`get txpower` - MeshCore's `set`/`get tx` has been renamed appropriately

## KISS Mode

KISS mode allows for operating the LoRA radio as a KISS modem, which makes it compatible with a lot of pre-existing radio software, including APRS software, and the Linux kernel.

### Enabling KISS Mode
 * Open a serial console and connect to the MeshTNC device
 * `serial mode kiss`

### Exiting KISS Mode
 * To exit KISS mode and return to CLI mode, you can send a KISS exit sequence like so: `echo -ne '\xC0\xFF\xC0' > /dev/ttyUSBx`
   * For this to work, ensure your serial port's settings and baud rate is set correctly with `stty`

## APRS over LoRa

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca4e8caf-5eff-44d3-8ff0-c9d57bfc6ca3" width="40%"></img> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa4506dd-34b6-4277-af8e-3470ef8f8dfa" width="40%"></img>

You can use your favorite APRS tools with MeshTNC. Simply select a frequency, place the radio into kiss mode and connect to your APRS tools as a KISS TNC device.

 * `minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0`
   * `set radio 918.25,500.0,7,5,0x16`
   * `serial mode kiss`

### APRS Software

MeshTNC should work with lots of APRS clients, we've tested on the following:

 * [xastir](https://xastir.org/index.php/Main_Page)
 * [APRSisce32](http://aprsisce.wikidot.com/)

## AX.25 over LoRA

There is a wealth of knowledge and examples available here: https://linux-ax25.in-berlin.de/wiki/AX.25

There's a lot of very interesting things that can be done directly over AX.25 without involving IP, but the following example will demonstrate how to assign an IP address to the AX.25 interface. This can be done on two different machines with two MeshTNC's, and you should be able to ping between them over the air, as long as the radio settings on the MeshTNC's match, the IP addresses assigned on each system are in the same subnet and different from one another, and the callsigns (or at least SSID's) differ on each system. IP routing will also work if configured properly!

### AX.25 Quick Start

* Attach the MeshTNC to a Linux system.
* Assign the proper radio settings on the MeshTNC CLI
* Enter KISS mode on the MeshTNC CLI
  * After entering KISS mode, please exit your terminal program to release the serial port.
* On the attached Linux system, edit `/etc/ax25/axports`:
  * Add the following line:
    * `0               AL1CE-1         115200  220     2       AX25 test`
    * Replace `AL1CE-1` with your callsign and SSID
* Attach the MeshTNC to the AX.25 port using: `kissattach /dev/ttyACM0 0`
  * After running this command, check to see what interface it created: `sudo dmesg | grep mkiss`
    * `[88447.885556] mkiss: ax0: crc mode is auto.`
* You can assign an IP address by running: `ip addr add 10.10.10.10/24 dev ax0`

## Ethernet over LoRa

Run the following on two or more computers, each with a MeshTNC device attached, to create an ethernet over LoRa network.

 * Install [`tncattach`](https://github.com/markqvist/tncattach)
   * `git clone https://github.com/markqvist/tncattach.git`
   * `cd tncattach`
   * `make`
   * `sudo make install`
 * `minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0`
   * `set radio 916.75,500.0,5,5,0x16`
   * `serial mode kiss`

### On the first machine

 * `sudo tncattach --mtu=230 -e -noipv6 --ipv4=10.10.10.10/24 /dev/ttyACM0 115200`

### On the second machine

 * `sudo tncattach --mtu=230 -e -noipv6 --ipv4=10.10.10.11/24 /dev/ttyACM0 115200`
